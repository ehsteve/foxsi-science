;	This routine takes in an energy array and performs the count-to-photon conversion 
;	using the inverse response.  No off-diagonal elements are included,
;	which is ok since the FOXSI response is almost completely diagonal.  Energy smearing
;	of the photon spectrum, however, is not properly accounted for here.  An iterative
;	procedure is necessary for that.
